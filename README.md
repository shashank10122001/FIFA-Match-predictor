# FIFA-Match-predictor
Built a classification model to predict the outcomes of a FIFA world cup match

## Introduction
The goal of this project is to predict match outcomes of WorldCup football matches accurately. Based on the dataset provided on kaggle.com that includes basic match data, I built a model to predict the probability of each match outcome â€“ win, draw, or defeat. I also compared multiple classification algorithms and choose the one that performs best on a separate test dataset.
